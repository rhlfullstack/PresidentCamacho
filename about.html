          <img src="whois.jpg" class="whois" alt="" />What kind of question is
          that? Shiiittt. Why anybody whos anybody knows who president Camacho
          in 2505. But it ain't even 2506 yet now is it? We gotta go all
          prehistoric just so yo' simple brains can contain it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So look it's like this. Camacho begins his career as a porn star, with
          his devilish good looks n' all. But soon come to find out that even
          though women is good, power is better. So he did what any heavily
          exfoliated muscular man with glorious hair would do and he becomes a
          pro wrestler. How good was he you ask? Only the five time Ultimate
          Smackdown Champion. And there is only one place you can go after
          reaching that kinda status. Oh yeah, all the way to the top baby.

          After winnin' the favor of the people, and being second smartest man
          alive, after Not Sure, and bein' half brain, half brawn, and half
          oratory genius, he was elected as the president of Uhmerica. All would
          be well, at least until the dust toilet bowl of 2505.

        <br />
        <p>
          See, Camacho humbles himself and knows to surround himself with the
          smartest people. That's why he had Not Sure travel from the past to
          fix the crop growin' issue. Who wouldda' thought that plants don't
          need no electrolytes? Only a genius like Not Sure. All was good, until
          they run outta' cheeze and forgot the recipe. Have you ever had pizza
          with no cheeze man?

        <p>
          So he is back to our time in 2023 to get the recipe. How'd he get here
          do you ask? Nobody knows, nobody cares, but what we do know, is this:
